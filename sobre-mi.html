                <p>I'm a self-taught backend developer in training, driven by curiosity and a desire 
                    to build real-world solutions. I specialize in Python, Django, and FastAPI, 
                    focusing on clean REST APIs, SQL integration, and maintainable backend logic.

                    My journey started with small scripts and evolved into full applications from 
                    password managers with encryption to savings tools based on Fibonacci logic. 
                    Each project reflects my commitment to learning, structure, and impact.

                    I communicate effectively in English (B2), collaborate remotely, and document 
                    my work using Git, GitHub. I'm methodical, resilient, and passionate about 
                    backend development as a way to solve meaningful problems. I'm open to remote
                    opportunities and relocation, especially to Canada or Sweden, where I can 
                    grow professionally while supporting my family's future. I believe in 
                    sharing knowledge, advocating for junior developers, and building 
                    technology that matters.</p>
